**Definition:**

A bipartite graph is a special kind of graph where the vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets, such that no two vertices within the same set are adjacent (directly connected).
It's often visualized as having two "parts" or "sides," with edges only connecting vertices from one part to the other.
Characteristics:

**Two Disjoint Sets:** Vertices can be clearly divided into two groups with no overlap.
No Odd Cycles: A bipartite graph cannot contain any cycles of odd length (e.g., triangles, pentagons).
Colorable with Two Colors: You can color all vertices in one set with one color and the vertices in the other set with a different color without any adjacent vertices having the same color.
Use Cases:

**Matching Problems:** Bipartite graphs are often used to model matching problems, such as assigning tasks to workers, students to courses, or goods to buyers.
Recommender Systems: They can be used to represent user-item interactions in recommender systems, identifying potential items to recommend to users.
Network Analysis: They can model social networks where edges represent friendships or connections between people with different roles or attributes.
Job Scheduling: They can model task dependencies in job scheduling scenarios, where vertices represent tasks and edges indicate which tasks must be completed before others.

**Java Example**

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Arrays;

public class BipartiteGraph {

    public boolean isBipartite(int[][] graph) {
        int n = graph.length;
        int[] colors = new int[n];
        Arrays.fill(colors, -1);

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (colors[i] == -1 && !dfs(graph, i, 0, colors)) {
                return false;
            }
        }

        return true;
    }

    private boolean dfs(int[][] graph, int node, int color, int[] colors) {
        if (colors[node] != -1) {
            return colors[node] == color;
        }

        colors[node] = color;

        for (int neighbor : graph[node]) {
            if (!dfs(graph, neighbor, 1 - color, colors)) {
                return false;
            }
        }

        return true;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BipartiteGraph solution = new BipartiteGraph();

        int[][] graph = {
            {1, 3},
            {0, 2},
            {1, 3},
            {0, 2}
        };

        boolean isBipartite = solution.isBipartite(graph);

        if (isBipartite) {
            System.out.println("The graph is Bipartite.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("The graph is not Bipartite.");
        }
    }
}

In this example, the isBipartite method checks if the given graph is Bipartite 
using DFS. The colors array is used to assign colors (0 or 1) to vertices, 
and the dfs method recursively explores the graph, ensuring that adjacent 
vertices have different colors. If at any point a conflict is detected, 
the graph is not Bipartite.
